        <h2>What are git and github ?</h2>
        <h3>Git : </h3>
        <p>Git is a free and open-source distributed "version control system". It helps developers track changes in their code and collaborate with others. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.</p>
        <h3>Version Control System : </h3>
        <p>A version control system (VCS) is a tool that helps track and manage changes to files over time. It allows you to save different versions of your project so you can go back to a previous version if something goes wrong. This is especially useful when working on large projects or with a team.</p>
        <h3>GitHub : </h3>
        <p>GitHub is a cloud-based platform that allows you to store, manage, and share your Git repositories. It adds collaboration features like pull requests, issue tracking, and more.</p>

        <h2>Why are Git and GitHub important ?</h2>
        <div class="info">
             <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Tracks Changes Over Time</li>
                <p>A VCS records every change made to files, allowing you to see what was modified, when, and by whom. This helps in understanding the evolution of a project.</p>
                <li>Restores Previous Versions</li>
                <p>If a mistake is made or if something breaks, a VCS lets you easily roll back to an earlier, stable version of the file or project.</p>
                <li>Keeps a History Log</li>
                <p>Every change is logged with a message, timestamp, and author name, helping you understand the reasoning behind changes and keeping a record for future reference.</p>
                <li>Supports Branching and Experimentation</li>
                <p>Developers can create separate branches to test features or ideas without affecting the main project. Once tested, changes can be merged back safely.</p>
                <li>Useful for Both Code and Content</li>
                <p>Although commonly used for code, version control can also be used for documents, designs, or any files where changes matter.</p>

            </ol>
